- Synchronize newly imported repositories when the auto-install mode is enabled

### Removed

- Don't unregister scripts from the Action List when disabling a repository anymore

- Remove the "Show descriptions" option in the package browser.
    The package description is now always shown instead of the raw filename when
    available. Package developers are encouraged to provide a nice name for their
    package without file extension or author name prefix.
