### Changed

#### General

#### About

- Always show the about tab in the about window even if package or repository documentation is empty or invalid

    logic, reusing HTTP connections and writing data directly to disk when
    applicable ([video comparison](https://youtube.com/watch?v=SqtpYnfvwVo))

#### Import repositories

- Preserve the repository's current auto-install setting when re-importing it
- Synchronize newly imported repositories when the auto-install mode is enabled

    The package description is now always shown instead of the raw filename when
    available. Package developers are encouraged to provide a nice name for their
    package without file extension or author name prefix.
